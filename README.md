A perceptron is a primitive neural network created by Rosenblatt for the task of pattern recognition. A single layer perceptron is a simple feed-forward neural network that is primarily used to classify linearly separable classes. Here, a single layer perceptron functioning in auto-associative mode is designed, trained and tested on a small dataset of alphanumeric characters.This model is built based on approach 1: Simple network with scalar output. The model is also re-tested on noise-corrupted image dataset to observe its performance. The goal is to optimize the SLP to give the best possible results.

Two approaches have been dealt with:

Approach 1 (SLP1.ipynb) : Heteroassociate model

Aprroach 2(SLP3.ipynb): Autoassociate model
